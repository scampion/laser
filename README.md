# LASER : Language Augmented Semantic Exploration and Retrieval

This project is an example of how LLMs can be used to enhance data and facilitate research. The idea is very simple. It consists of requesting a language model, a title and one or more summaries of different lengths if necessary, which are then added to the initial data. The rest of the information search is similar to the RAG workflow, except that we search in three different sources: titles, summaries and chunks of text to achieve a better quality hierarchical search.

 This project also includes the implementation of a search tool entirely based on JavaScript, to enable the search engine to be used offline and in a truly confidential way, since it does not require any server. This is also a way of facilitating the operational deployment of this type of search engine.
